This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

Below you will find some simple information about how to run the app and make changes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run api`

A fake API service (using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)) is available at [http://localhost:3003/files](http://localhost:3003/files). For details of the available API Methods, please read the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) documentation.

### Tasks

Once you've set up the repo successfully and run `npm start` along with `npm run api`, you should have the app running in development mode along with a simple API service.

Please carry out the tasks below:

1. Retrieve a list of files and display them.
2. Provide a way of sorting the files based on, e.g., size.
3. Provide a way of filtering the files based on file name.
4. Provide some tests for your new functionality.

This repository is purposefully bare-bones: no state management or library for asynchronous requests are included. Feel free to install your preferred libraries and structure things as you see fit.

In order to achieve the above tasks, you will have to give the app some structure (e.g. perhaps a reducer to handle actions, new React Components). Though the tasks are fairly simple, you should follow best practices to ensure you could build on it in the future. Use your preferred libraries and approaches to achieve the tasks.
